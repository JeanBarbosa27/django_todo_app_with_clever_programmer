# Ideas for improvements
The idea here is to note what will be done and update the status into parentesis

## Video goal
Allow users to keep track of things they need to done

### User stories
- User can view his/her list of todo items - **done**
- User can create a new todo item - **done**
- User can delete a todo item - **done**

## My ideas
- Insert login feature using django admin authenication - **todo**
- Add description to the todo item - **todo**
- Add a detail view for the todo item - **todo**
