# Django To Do List with Clever Programmer
This project was created for following a YouTube tutorial video called **Python Django Tutorial 2020 - Full Course for Beginners** from Clever Programmer channel. The video is actually a compiled of 8 hours and a half join many things, but this project refers exactly to time video's [6:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT80XhYJdBwt=24352s). My goal here is to follow what is done and contribute with my own ideas, which I'll take note into the [ideas for improvements](./ideas_for_improvements.md) file. Into this file are the video goals too.

## Project dependencies
To get dependencies intallations easy, it was used the pipenv with a newer Python and Django versions than are used in the tutorial. Therefore, **ensure that you have pipenv installed in your machine** and, before everything, install all project dependencies with the following commands line `pipenv shell` and then `pipenv install`.
In the tutorial it's used the Repl.it, which get ready with a django environment, but I prefered buid it from scratch to practice and simulate how to create a real project.

## Run locally
Everytime you need to run it locally, remember to activate the virtual environment with the following command line `pipenv shell` and then, considering that you are at the same directory of manage.py file, run the command line `python manage.py runserver` or if you prefer, just type `./manage.py runserver`.
